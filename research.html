          <h1>Why is Pet Abandonment an issue?</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="responsePage02">
          <p>No matter the situation, the pet animal suffers. Pet animals, like dogs and cats, can feel similar emotions to those experienced by people. Pets can experience stress, anxiety, and fear. Abandoned pet animals are left to fend for themselves, leading to an uncertain fate for these animals. Domestication can also hinder the development of their basic hunting skills. Often these animals do not have to worry about hunting for their food because it's provided for them by their pet owners.<br><br>Animal abandonment is animal cruelty and is illegal in New York.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Abandoned pet animals are exposed to diseases and extreme weather conditions and are likely to experience distress, confusion, and hunger  if not rescued by local shelters, rescue organizations or the authorities. But many abandoned animals are not rescued and will have to live in fear and fend for themselves.<br><br></li>
            <li>Unweaned puppies and kittens are more likely to die.<br><br></li>
            <li>Contributes to an existing stray animal overpopulation problem, especially if the pet animal isnâ€™t neutered or spayed.<br><br></li>
            <li>Animal shelters are severely impacted financially, often struggling with having enough resources and supplies to take care of all animals. Many animal shelters reach full capacity and will have to euthanize some animals to make more space for other animals.<br><br></li>
